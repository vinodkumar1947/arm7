**ARM Processors Architecture Overview**

    Development of the ARM Architecture
    
ARM has introduced many processors. Each set or groups of processors are having different core and different Features. Development of the ARM Architecture is started with 26 bit processors and now a days it reach upto 64 bit. we can not classify general  development of ARM products on any particular fact, there is only one way to understand ARM based products is on its Architectural version profile.

**ARM Classic series:**
The classical ARM series refers to processors starting from ARM7 to ARM11. This is the series which gives market boost to ARM because of its core features like Data Tightly Coupled memory, cache, MMU, MPU, etc. Typical examples of this series are ARM7TDMI, ARM926EJ-S, ARM11 MPCore, etc.

**Cortex-A series:**
A-profile, the “**Application**” profile
In this Cortex architecture, we port different embedded OS and design embedded system by OS system programming. The core feature of this profile is Highest performance at low power,  TrustZone and Jazelle-RCT for a safe and extensible system. Practical development platform of this types of profile  is FriendlyARM, Raspberry Pi, etc.
